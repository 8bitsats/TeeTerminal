Overview

Tee Telegram Bot represents the next generation of decentralized finance tools, combining advanced AI, secure execution environments, and cross-platform capabilities in one seamless system. Built on the principles of security, transparency, and accessibility, it brings institutional-grade crypto trading tools to everyday users.

Originally based on the "Based Cheshire Trading Terminal Bot" whitepaper, the system has evolved into a comprehensive platform that leverages:

* Telegram for mobile access and notifications
* Solana blockchain for high-performance transactions
* TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) for secure operations
* Advanced AI models (grok-3-mini-fast-beta) for trading insights and chain-of-thought reasoning

Getting StartedInstallation

1. **Find the bot on Telegram**: Search for "TeeGPT Bot" in Telegram or use the direct link: `t.me/TeeGPTBot`
2. **Start the conversation**: Send `/start` to initiate the bot
3. **Link your wallet**: Use the `/connect` command to link your Solana wallet
4. **Access the web terminal**: Type `/terminal` to get a link to the full web interface

Basic Commands

* `/help` - Display all available commands
* `/status` - Check your wallet and bot status
* `/market` - Get current market analysis
* `/research` - Activate the research mode with chain-of-thought reasoning
* `/trade` - Enter trading mode
* `/portfolio` - View your current portfolio

Secure Transaction Execution

All trades are executed through the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), ensuring:

* Transaction privacy
* Protection from front-running
* Secure key management
* Tamper-proof execution

Cross-Platform Accessibility

The platform is accessible through multiple interfaces:

* Telegram Bot for mobile access

* Portfolio overview
* One-tap trading execution
* Notification preferences
* Quick-access to AI assistant

Technical Implementation

The Mini App is built using:

* Telegram Bot API 6.0+
* Telegram Mini App SDK
* WebView integration with secure authentication
* Local state management for responsive UI
* TEE-authenticated API calls

Security Model

The Mini App maintains security through:

* End-to-end encryption for all communications
* Session-based authentication
* TEE verification for all transactions
* Non-persistent sensitive data
* Secure WebView sandboxing

Web Terminal Interface

The web terminal provides the most comprehensive interface for power users.

Interface Components

* **Dashboard**: Overview of market conditions, portfolio performance, and recent activities
* **Trading View**: Advanced charting, order placement, and market depth visualization
* **AI Terminal**: Full-featured AI assistant with research mode and chain-of-thought reasoning
* **Portfolio Manager**: Detailed analysis of holdings, performance metrics, and tax reporting
* **Bot Settings**: Configure automated trading strategies, risk parameters, and notification preferences

Research Mode

The research mode enables the AI's chain-of-thought reasoning capability:

1. Shows step-by-step reasoning process
2. Displays source data considerations
3. Explains analytical methodology
4. Traces conclusion formation
5. Provides confidence metrics

Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

The TEE is the cornerstone of the Tee platform's security model, providing hardware-level isolation for sensitive operations.

Technical Architecture

The TEE implementation uses a multi-layered approach:

1. **Hardware Secure Enclaves**: Using technologies like Intel SGX or ARM TrustZone
2. **Remote Attestation**: Verifying the integrity of the execution environment
3. **Secure Key Management**: Private keys never leave the secure enclave
4. **Encrypted Memory**: All sensitive computations occur in encrypted memory space
5. **Verifiable Execution**: Cryptographic proof of execution integrity

Communication Flow

1. User submits a request (trade, analysis, etc.)
2. Request is encrypted and sent to the TEE
3. TEE verifies request authenticity and user authorization
4. Operation is executed in the isolated environment
5. Result is encrypted and returned to the user
6. Blockchain transaction (if applicable) is signed within the TEE

Integration with Telegram

The TEE extends to the Telegram environment through:

1. End-to-end encrypted channels
2. Secure bootstrapping of the Mini App
3. Verified origin for all communications
4. TEE-based authentication of the Telegram Bot
5. Isolated execution contexts for sensitive operations

Solana Integration

The platform leverages Solana's high-performance blockchain for trading operations.

Technical Implementation

* **Transaction Processing**: Direct integration with Solana's Transaction Processing Units (TPUs)
* **Program Deployment**: Custom on-chain programs for specialized trading operations
* **State Management**: Optimized account structures for efficient state updates
* **Concurrency**: Parallel transaction execution for high-frequency trading
* **Fee Optimization**: Dynamic fee management for cost-effective operation

TEE-to-Solana Security Model

1. Private keys are generated and stored exclusively within the TEE
2. Transactions are constructed, signed, and verified within the TEE
3. Only signed transactions exit the TEE, never private keys
4. Remote attestation ensures TEE integrity before transaction signing
5. On-chain programs verify TEE attestation reports

AI Capabilities

The AI system combines multiple specialized models for different aspects of trading and analysis.
