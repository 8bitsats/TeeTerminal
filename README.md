### Introduction to TEEs

Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) represent one of the most significant innovations in computational security. At their core, TEEs are isolated processing environments with enhanced security features that provide integrity protection, confidentiality, and attestation capabilities for the code and data loaded inside them.

#### What Makes TEEs Special?

TEEs create a secure enclave within a processor, separated from the standard operating system. This isolation ensures that even if the main system is compromised, the data and processes within the TEE remain protected. Think of a TEE as a vault inside your computer that even the computer's administrator cannot access.

Key properties of TEEs include:

* **Isolation**: Code and data within a TEE are isolated from the rest of the system
* **Confidentiality**: Information inside the TEE is encrypted and protected
* **Integrity**: The system can verify that the TEE code hasn't been tampered with
* **Attestation**: The ability to prove to outside parties that the correct code is running in a genuine TEE

#### Common TEE Technologies

Several major TEE implementations exist today:

1. **Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions)**: Hardware-based memory encryption that isolates specific application code and data in memory
2. **ARM TrustZone**: Creates two separate worlds (secure and non-secure) in which the processor operates
3. **AMD SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization)**: Provides encrypted virtual machine isolation
4. **AWS Nitro Enclaves**: Isolated compute environments for processing sensitive data on AWS

### How TEEs Work

TEEs function through a combination of hardware and software security measures that create an isolated execution environment.
