# Use Cases For Tee in Web 3

#### 1. Private DeFi Assistants

AI agents operating in TEEs could manage your DeFi portfolio, executing trades and yield farming strategies without exposing your wallet contents or trading strategies to anyone. The blockchain verifies transactions while the TEE ensures privacy.

#### 2. Secure Crypto Trading Signals

Trading signals and analysis could be generated by AI within TEEs using proprietary algorithms that remain secure, while still providing verifiable results on the blockchain.

#### 3. Cross-Chain Privacy

TEEs could facilitate private cross-chain transactions where AI agents coordinate asset transfers between different blockchains without exposing transaction details.

#### 4. On-Chain AI Governance

DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) could employ AI agents in TEEs to help analyze proposals and execute governance decisions with guaranteed integrity.

#### 5. Private NFT Creation and Trading

Artists could use AI assistants to create and trade NFTs while keeping their creative process and identity private if desired, with the blockchain only recording the final transaction.

#### 6. Front-Running Protection

TEEs can prevent malicious actors from seeing pending transactions before they're confirmed, protecting users from front-running attacks that plague many DeFi protocols.

Let me now create a React landing page for ChatMCP that incorporates these concepts.
